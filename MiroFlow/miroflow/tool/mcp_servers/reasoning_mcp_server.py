    IMPORTANT: This tool cannot access the internet, read files, program, or process multimodal content. It only performs pure text reasoning.

    Use this tool for:
    - Integrating and synthesizing collected information
    - Analyzing patterns and relationships in data
    - Logical reasoning and problem-solving
    - Planning and strategy development
    - Complex math problems, puzzles, riddles, and IQ tests

    DO NOT use this tool for simple and obvious questions.

    Args:
        question: The complex question or problem requiring step-by-step reasoning. Should include all relevant information needed to solve the problem.

    Returns:
        The reasoned answer to the question.
