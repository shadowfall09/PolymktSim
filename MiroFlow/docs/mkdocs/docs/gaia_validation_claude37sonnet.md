## Running the Evaluation

### Step 1: Dataset Preparation

Follow the [dataset preparation instructions](gaia_validation_prerequisites.md#dataset-preparation) in the prerequisites document.

### Step 2: API Keys Configuration

Configure the following API keys in your `.env` file:

```env title="Claude 3.7 Sonnet .env Configuration"
# Primary LLM provider (Claude-3.7-Sonnet via OpenRouter)
OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-openrouter-api-key"
OPENROUTER_BASE_URL="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"

# Search and web scraping capabilities
SERPER_API_KEY="your-serper-api-key"
JINA_API_KEY="your-jina-api-key"

# Code execution environment
E2B_API_KEY="your-e2b-api-key"

# Vision understanding capabilities
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-api-key"
GEMINI_API_KEY="your-gemini-api-key"

# LLM judge, reasoning, and hint generation
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://api.openai.com/v1"
```

### Step 3: Run the Evaluation

!!! note "Configuration Note"
    The current standard benchmark configurations primarily use MiroThinker. To run with Claude 3.7 Sonnet, create a custom config based on the standard configs with a Claude LLM provider. See [YAML Configuration Guide](yaml_config.md) for details.

### Step 4: Monitor Progress

Follow the [progress monitoring instructions](gaia_validation_prerequisites.md#progress-monitoring-and-resume) in the prerequisites document.
